    "In this project, we'll aim to find 5 hot Hacker News posting hours for people in Pakistan so they can have a higher chance of receiving more comments on their posts. Hacker News is a popular website where technology related posts or stories are voted and commented on. We are interested in posts who's titles begin with `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",

    "We'll analyze existing data about Hacker News posts to find the hot HN posting hours in Pakistan. To support our recommendation, we'll try to find out:\n",
